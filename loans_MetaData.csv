1,"The target population for the 2018 National Graduates Survey (NGS) (class of 2015) corresponds to graduates of public postsecondary educational institutions in Canada during the 2015 calendar year who were living in Canada at the time of the interview."
2,"This table excludes graduates who pursued further education between graduation and the time of the interview."
3,"Field of study refers to the major field of study reported by each graduate, with each response assigned a 6-digit code within the standard statistical classification system “Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016”. The Field of study dimension includes an aggregate across all fields of study (all CIP codes), as well as two separate and distinct standard aggregate groupings of CIP codes. The first of these groupings is “Variant of CIP - Primary groupings”, and includes 12 primary grouping categories.  The second of these is “Variant of CIP 2016 - STEM and BHASE groupings”, and includes the two categories STEM and BHASE. The STEM fields of study include science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer sciences. The BHASE fields of study encompass business, humanities, health, arts, social science, education, as well as legal studies, trades, services, natural resources and conservation. The “Variant of CIP 2016 - STEM and BHASE groupings” is not a higher level aggregation of “Variant of CIP - Primary groupings”."
4,"The Canada-level estimates include the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
5,"All estimates were subject to rounding."
6,"Quality indicators are provided for selected estimates, and are displayed as a superscript beside the estimate.  The quality indicator is based on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimate and the number of unweighted respondent records that contribute to the estimate. The quality indicators for the 2018 National Graduates Survey (NGS) (class of 2015) are:  A: Excellent - CV is less than or equal to 0.05;  B: Very good - CV is greater than 0.05 and less than or equal to 0.15;  C: Good - CV is greater than 0.15 and less than or equal to 0.25;  D: Acceptable - CV is greater than 0.25 and less than or equal to 0.35;  E: Use with caution - CV is greater than 0.35 or the number of records that contribute to the estimate is less than 10.  The quality indicators for the previous cycles of the NGS are: E: Use with caution - CV greater than or equal to 16.6 and less than or equal to 33.3;  F: Too unreliable to be published - CV greater than 33.3."
7,"College includes college or other non-university certificates, college or other non-university diplomas, collège d'enseignement général et professionnel (CEGEP) certificates, and CEGEP diplomas."
8,"Bachelor's includes bachelor's degrees (excluding degrees in law, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, and pharmacy), university certificates below bachelor's degrees, and university diplomas below bachelor's degrees."
9,"Professional includes undergraduate degree and post-baccalaureate non-graduate degree programs in law, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, and pharmacy."
10,"Master's includes master's degrees, university certificates above bachelor's degrees, and university diplomas above bachelor's degrees."
11,"This variable is derived using the “Variant of CIP 2016 - STEM and BHASE groupings”, a variant of the ""Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016"", which classifies fields of study into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer sciences) and BHASE (business, humanities, health, arts, social science, education, as well as legal studies, trades, services, natural resources and conservation)."
12,"Percentage of debt paid off at time of interview = ((GRAD - INT)/GRAD) * 100%, where:  GRAD =  total amount of debt at graduation for all graduates who had debt;  INT = total amount of debt at the time of the interview for all graduates who had debt at graduation."
13,"Includes graduates who had completely repaid their student loans at time of interview."
14,"Excludes graduates who had completely repaid their student loans at time of interview."
