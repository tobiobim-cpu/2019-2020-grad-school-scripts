###Classical Definition of Data Science (DS)
      #DS comprises of 3-core elements: 1) Programming skills. (2) Math and Stat Know-how. (3) Subject Matter Expertise.
         # Progamming Skills include: 1) Python, (2) R, (3) SQL (4)JavaScript[D3.js-presentation] -> Data prep & aggregation, analysis, visualization, predictive modeling
         # Math and Stat -> Advanced Algebra, Linear Algebra, Probability-[Log Reg], Bayes Classfication, Calculus-[gradient descent and NN]
         #Subject matter expertise: Is what distinguish data scientists from statistician and mathematician.

###Data Scientists must be: 1) able to evaluate industry-specifics related to what the data tells them.
                         #  2)Understand what the data is telling them, without reliance on other subject matter expertise.

###Machine Learning -> Process of deploying compute power to identify trends and patterns in data in order to make---
                      # --- predictions about how that data will behave in the future.

#### WHY PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE????
         #It's a high-level, interpreted, open-source coding langauge that's useful for a very wide variety of applications
         #It's also the OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF GOOGLE
         #It can be used for DS, DE, ML, DA, DV, WD etc

####4 -main libraries for DV; 1) Matplotlib, 2) Seaborn, 3) ggplot, 4) GraphX, 5) Plotly
      #It can be used for: 1) Exploratory Data Analysis, Data storytelling, Decision-support dashboard design, Public education(news, media, and data blogging)

####Python for ML -> Libraries: 1) Scikit-learn, 2) TensorFlow[deep learning], 3) PyTorch
      #The libraries can be used for ML algo func: 1)Regression, 2)Clustering, 3)Deep learning, 4)Decision trees, 5)Bayesian, 6)Instance-based classification.

####Python for DE-> learn to build simple MapReduce jobs[without JAVA], write Spark jobs[without Scala], programming IoT devices[like Raspberry Pi], building Extract,Transform&Load[ETL] processes[with Airflow]

##### WHERE DOES AI FIT??? --> ML vs AI vs ROBOTICS
       #ML is the brain behind AI. It's the decision-making Mechanism. Makes prediction upon which actions are taken
         # See line 10. 
         #w.r.t to AI, the decision-engine in a piece of AI technology "can be" comprised of ML models
         #3-sections: 1)Supervised, 2)Unsupervised and 3) Reinforment Learning

##AI is ML intelligence brought into the real world[is the machinery embedded with ML intelligence]. Like an actual robot
    # AI is the m/c or app with the capacity to autonomously execute upon predictions it makes 4rm data
       #it has 2-elements: 1) Prediction, 2) Execution
           #Prediction comes from predictive modeling while Execution comes from some sort of Autonomous response
           # In reality, it is Combination of ML and software development

##Robotics: Design, contruction, and operation of progrmmable m/c that are capable of automatically executing a series of complex tasks
