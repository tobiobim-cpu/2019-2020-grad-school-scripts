####Machine learning 101 - ML is the brain behind AI technologies. A field of CS where algorithm learn from data.
                    #Art and science of giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data without been explicitly programmed
                    #It combines: 1) Computational Statistics, 2)Pattern recognition, 3)mathematical Optimization, 4)Computational learning theory in AI
                    #It also involves data mining and Exploratory Data Analysis[EDA] -> helps you understand the structure of the data.
    #Examples of ML -> 1)Sales Forecasting, 2)Customer Segment Analysis, 3)Insurance claim fraud detection, 4)Hedge Fund Classification, 4)Spam detection
    #Applications -> Adaptive websites, Medical diagnosis, Stock market analysis, Robot locomotion, NLP, Credit card fraud detection, Speech and handwriting detection, Autonous cars

##ML models can do the following:
                       #Identify ralationship btw variables(regression -> ML algo by func)
                       #Assign new data to the correct group(classification -> ML algo by func)
                       #Find the dist of inputs in a certain space(density estimation)
                       #Simplify inputs by mapping them into a lower dimensional space(dimensionality reduction -> ML algo by func)
                       #Group similar data points together without knowing the groups beforehand(clustering)

##ML course covers the following:
                       #Regression -> Linear and Logistic Regression
                       #Clustering -> K-means, Hierarchical methods, DBSCAN
                       #Dimension Reduction -> Explantory Factor Analysis[EFA], Principal component analysis[PCA]
                       #Instanced-Based -> KNN algorithm
                       #Deep Learning -> Perceptron
                       #Association Rules -> Using Apriori
                       #Decision Trees -> CART
                       #Bayesian -> Naive Bayes
                       #Ensemble Methods -> Random forest

###ML LINGO
         #Feature: synonymous to variable, column, attribute, and field
         #Instances: synonymou44s to rows, observation, datapoint, value, and case
         #Target: synonymous with the terms predictant and dependent variable. It's basically what we are predicting for
         #Data: synonymous to a predictor or set of predictor variables. It's basically the data we are feeding into ML algo
    #Test and Training Sets:
        #Use random sampling to generate random samples and then break the data into test and traing sets
        #4/5(80%) of your dataset -> Training set [use it to train your model]
        #1/5(20%) of your dataset -> Test set [to see how well the model performs]
    #Types of ML methods:
        #Supervised learning ->  Making PREDICTIONS or uncoverinG HIDDEN PATTERNS straight from LABELED data. E.g. Spam detection
        #Unsupervised learning -> Making PREDICTIONS or uncoverinG HIDDEN PATTERNS straight from UNLABELED data. You would have to group the unlabeled data first and find similarities
             #e.g. Grouping customers into distinct categories based on their purchasing behaviour without knowing in advance what these categories might be. (Clustering)
        #Semi-Supervised learning -> Uses both LABELED and UNLABELED data to make a set of predictions
        #Reinforcement learning -> m\c or softwre agents interact with an environment, learning how to optimize their behaviour given a system of rewards and punishment


####Grouping ML Algorithms
   #By Learning type: Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised
        #If your data is LABELED [SUPERVISED LEARNING] and it is:
             #Continous ---> REGRESSION (quantify relationship btw at least one predictor variable 'x' and response variable 'y')
             #Categorical --> CLASSIFICATION (learns from labeled data to predict categories for new datapoints. discrete&unordered values)
        #If your data is UNLABELED [UNSUPERVISED LEARNING] and it is:
             #Continous ---> DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION (take unlabeled conti high-dimensional data and compresses it into smaller synthetic rep)
             #Categorical --> CLUSTERING (takes unlabeled categ data and organizes it into clusters based on similrity in attribute values of the data points)

   #By Function: See Line 14 -23
   
   #By Use cases: Fraud detection, Recommendation engines, Price forecasting, Inventory demand forecasting, Water consumption forecasting, Infrastructure demand forecasting, etc
        #K-Means clustering:
            #Location-based crime prediction and prevention
            #customer segmentation for marketing
            #Document classification
            #Insurance fraud prediction and prevention
            #IT operational efficiencies
            #Oil and gas site eveluations
            #Video analytics
            #Patient segmentation for preventative medicine
